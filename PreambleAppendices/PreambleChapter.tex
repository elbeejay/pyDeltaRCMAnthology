\section{Preamble}
``Exploring \textit{pyDeltaRCM}" is a collection of short numerical studies intended to help the reader gain a greater intuition for how the \textit{pyDeltaRCM} model \cite{Moodie2021} behaves.
Each chapter is independent of the others, however all chapters assume basic knowledge of \textit{pyDeltaRCM}.
For background on the \textit{pyDeltaRCM} model and its predecessor, \textit{DeltaRCM}, please refer to \citet{Liang2015a}, \citet{Liang2015}, and \citet{Moodie2021}.
The \textit{pyDeltaRCM} model is open-source software with documentation available at \url{https://deltarcm.org/pyDeltaRCM/} and source-code on GitHub (\url{https://github.com/DeltaRCM/pyDeltaRCM}).\\

\noindent Please contact the authors to further discuss any topics covered within this anthology.
